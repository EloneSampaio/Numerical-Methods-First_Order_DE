# Numerical-Methods-First_Order_DE
Python codes for numerical methods in first order differential equations:
Euler's method, modified Euler's method, Runge-Kutta method, Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method and Milne's method.

NOTE: Problems/examples sovled are taken from Schaum's Outline of Differential Equations. 
Read the hashtag comment below to find out which question the code is computing for.

Additional details: I coded all these under 45 minutes while reviewing ODE using Schaum's book. Could've further refined the codes but I have to move on fast in my speed-learning project.
